# Voice-Based-Health-Classification
This project is focused on the analysis and modeling of audio features of patient voice recordings,that were extracted from 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' patients. This was done in order to build a model that can accurately identify a patients health status based on key vocal parameters.

# Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover key relationships between the various vocal parameters
Build a predictive model to classify patients based on their health status
Visualize insights in a Power BI dashboard
Report on findings
